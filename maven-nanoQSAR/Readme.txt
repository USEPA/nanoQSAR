****************************************************************

The purpose of this nanoQSAR software project is to generate an
equation which can be used to predict the in vitro viability (toxicity)
of human cells exposed to different types and concentrations of nanomaterials.
The equation used for prediction is generated by performing a linear regression
on data mined from the MySQL nanomaterial database “NaKnowBase” located on one
of USEPA’s NCCT servers.  Currently, the database is limited by the few cases
found in literature.  However, it will be expanded by USEPA toxicologist
performing their own experiments; conducting in vitro assays using various
concentration of other nanomaterials and adjusting other experimental parameters.

In the directory:

L:\Priv\Cin\NRMRL\CompTox\nanoQSAR

There is the batch file nanoQSAR.bat that first runs the jar file nanoQSAR.jar,
then runs the jar file nanoQSAR_PLS.jar, and then the jar file nanoQSAR_PRED.jar.

The first jar file data mines the remote EPA database "NaKnowBase" and combines
all of the data contained in many tables of the relational database, and converts
all of this data to a simple spreadsheet comma separated variables (CSV) format file
nanoQSAR.csv.  Every record of this spreadsheet is a unique combination of data
from the multiple tables in the relational database.

The second jar file reads the nanoQSAR.csv file and performs a linear regression
(QSAR) on the data to find an equation that relates the descriptor variables in a
record to the resultant variables in a record.   This result of the analysis is
output to the file nanoQSAR_BPLS.csv and contains the b coefficients of the equation
Y = b0 + b1*X1 + b2 *X2 + … + bm * Xm , where Y is the predicted in vitro viability
of human cells exposed to the varying concentrations of the nanomaterials, and
Xi are descriptors of all experiments, including properties of the nanomaterials.

The third jar file reads the filename nanoQSAR_PLS.cvs where the beta coefficients
are stored, and the nanoQSAR.csv file for the records with no results. Experimental
results are predicted for rows in nanoQSAR.csv that contain no results. The predicted
results are then output to the file nanoQSAR_Predictions.csv.

This software should be used by clicking on the nanoQSAR.bat file, either from the
command line in that directory, or by clicking on it from the graphics display.
When executing from the command line, there are two numbers output, R2 and Q2avg.
Both of these take on values in the range [0.0, 1.0] where 1.0 > R2 > Q2avg > 0.0.
R2 is a measure of how well the model can be built to describe results, and Q2 is
a measure of how well the model predicts results by cross-validation.  In cross-
validation, the data is randomly separated into two parts; the data used to build
the model (training data) and the data used to test the model (test data).

As it is now, these values are close to R2 = 0.69 and Q2avg ~ 0.60, depending on
the random division of training/test data.  This is primarily because the database
is limited in the types of nanomaterials investigated and entered at this time.

There is also the file nanoQSAR-1-develop.zip in the directory mentioned above that
contains all of the source code used to generate the jar files, and the source code
of the testers used to run all associated unit tests.  These files are Maven projects
within Eclipse.  The source code for the jar files and testers can be compiled and
run using Eclipse IDE.
